# Get Help

## User Groups

Because there are 3 distinct pieces to SWAT+, we have created user groups for each. Please identify which area you are having difficulty with and choose the appropriate group:

[**QSWAT+ user group**](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/qswatplus)  
For issues defining your watershed in QGIS and using the QSWAT+ plugin.

[**SWAT+ Editor user group**](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/swatplus-editor)  
For issues related to the editor interface.

[**SWAT+ model user group**](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/swatplus)  
For questions and discussion related to the model itself, not the editor or GIS interfaces.

## SWAT+ Editor Bug/Issue Reporting

For SWAT+ Editor bugs or technical issues, report to the user groups or the [Bitbucket issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/swatplus/swatplus.editor/issues?status=new&status=open). However, please use this only for **Editor software problems**, and continue to use the google group for data-related issues.
