# Analyze Output

After successfully running the model, click the graph icon in the leftmost blue toolbar, then click the import output button to read your SWAT+ output files into a SQLite database. When you are done, close the SWAT+ Editor window to return to QSWAT+. From here, the step 4 button should be enabled in QSWAT+ and you can plot or map your output.

To change the output printed in your model run, go to the edit inputs section of SWAT+ Editor, and click print under the simulation section. Choose the data you want to print, save changes, then re-write input files and re-run the model.

See the simulation section documentation linked below for help with print options.
