# Run SWAT+

After writing your input files, click the arrow button in the leftmost blue toolbar to go to the run SWAT+ section. Click the button to run the model. A progress window will pop up displaying the results from the model executable program.

If you encounter an error, check the box to run the debug version and run the model again. Copy the contents of the output error and [see our SWAT+ model user group](../../get-help.md) for help diagnosing the problem.
