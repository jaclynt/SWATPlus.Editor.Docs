# Write Input Files

When you are done editing your input data, click the pencil icon in the leftmost blue toolbar to go to the write input files section. Select the directory to save your files \(if coming from GIS, your default scenario TxtInOut directory is chosen by default\), and click the save and write files button.

A progress bar will pop up showing the files being written. When complete, you can proceed to the next step: running the model. Click the arrow button in the leftmost blue toolbar.

You must have weather stations before being allowed to write input files.
{% endhint %}

If you need to make additional changes to your SWAT+ input data, be sure to come back to this step and re-write your files before running the model again.
